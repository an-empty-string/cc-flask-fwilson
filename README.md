# cc-flask-fwilson

This is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for
apps that I develop for myself. It's mostly to make sure I stay fairly
consistent with respect to page style and code style.

## Usage

```
$ cookiecutter gh:fwilson42/cc-flask-fwilson
```

Follow the prompts, and you'll get an output directory in `project_name` that's
ready to run.
